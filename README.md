# About
Hi there.This is Glous.
## Details
I'm a freshman in high school,so I don't coding very often.I might push some code during official holidays.
## Code
My usual languages are Java and C++, but I'm still just getting started.I am interested in the low level of computer such as Compiler, Virtual Machine, Operating System and Integrated Circuit.What's more,I like to implement mature projects myself because this brings me a sense of Honor.
